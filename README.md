# List the things you added for points:
- Created an interactive fiction story with at least 8 knots.
- Created at least one major choice the player can make/reflect that choice back to the player. Example of one: The more granola bars you pick up, the more treasue you can make. If you make 0 treasure, you get a different ending than someone who got 2-4 pieces of treasure or 5 pieces of treasure.
- Inlcude at least one loop. Example: The treasure pond loops through the different kinds of tresure you can recieve. (gold bars, jewels, necklaces)
- Included more than 16 passages.
- Allowed the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledges if the player does not have a certain item. Example: You can pick up a flashlight. If you don't have the flashlight you cannot progress because it will be too dark to see. Example: You can pick up your satchel and sticks. You must have both to be able to make a splint. If you do not have both materials the game will tell you that you need to get them before crafting a splint.
- Gives the player statistics, and allows them to upgrade once or twice. Gates certain options based on statistics. Example: You are "too weak" to move the stone and progress unless you make a splint for your leg. Once you make the splint, you become stronger and are able to move the stone and walk around freely.
- Keeps track of visited passages and changes displayed description based on visits/actiosn. Example: One example is in the first room "==lookaround==". If you don't pick up the flashlight or satchel, the room description will tell you they're on the ground. If you pick up one, it will tell you the other is on the ground. If you pick up both, neither will be described as being on the ground.
