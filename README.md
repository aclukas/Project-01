# List the things you added for points
-interactive fiction story with more than 8 passages/knots.
-one major choice that player can make (deciding to pick up the lighter (which is necessary later), deciding character traits and food chocie which affects the player's strength or intelligence.)
-one short loop: in the ==rightroomlit== knot. Changes the last sentence about what you are hearing in seeing in the room.
-allow players to pick up items and change the state of the game (picking up the lighter allows you to see later on, picking up the dime allows you to escape IF you have enough intelligence)
-passages change based on knots you have been to (aka keeps track of visited passages)->==mainarea== knot. If you've been to the vending machine, you notice a change in your surroundings.
